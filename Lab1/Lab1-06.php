<!-- 6. Use while() to print a table of Fahrenheit and Celsius temperature
equivalents from –50 degrees F to 50 degrees F in 5-degree
increments. On the Fahrenheit temperature scale, water freezes at
32 degrees and boils at 212 degrees. On the Celsius scale, water
freezes at 0 degrees and boils at 100 degrees. So, to convert from
Fahrenheit to Celsius, you subtract 32 from the temperature,
multiply by 5, and divide by 9. To convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit,
you multiply by 9, divide by 5, and then add 32. -->
