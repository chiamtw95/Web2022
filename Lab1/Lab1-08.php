<!-- 8. Printing the BMI of a User: Suppose you decide one day you want to
monitor your health, but don't want to use a third-party tool. You
could build a simple tool to take measurements including name,
weight, and height. From there, you can calculate your BMI.
In this activity, you will write a script that will take variables from
the script in order to perform calculations to get a BMI result. You
will set a number of defaults, but also build an option to specify your
own data via query strings.
Here are the steps to complete the activity:
a. Create a tracker.php file.
b. Define a $name string to store the name of the user.
c. Define a $weightKg integer to store the weight in kilograms.
d. Define a $heightCm integer to store the height in centimeters.
e. Convert the height to meters.
f. Calculate the value of the height squared.
g. Calculate the BMI by dividing the user's weight by the value of
the height squared.
h. Display a message to the screen displaying the name and BMI
result -->
